npm install

npm run build
npm run app-package

Developer Mode is enabled only for 50 hours, so you will need to renew developer session every 50 hours to keep using Crunchyroll as app... If you want to develop changes on the project, use the ``develop`` command to open a static web server and watch changes / build while you develop:

```bash
# This command creates a static web server available on your desktop
# You can test it direct from the browser
npm run develop
```
